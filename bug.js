This error occurs when using a third-party library that expects a specific type of data, but the data passed to it is of a different type.  This often happens when dealing with asynchronous operations where the data isn't fully loaded before being used. For instance, using data from a state variable before it has been updated by an API call.

```javascript
//Incorrect usage
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData().then(data => setMyData(data));
}, []);

//Accessing data before it's available
<Text>{myData.someProperty}</Text> // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'someProperty')
```
